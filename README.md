Website design for an artist friend of mine. He creates mesmerizing acrylic pour fine art using old vinyls he finds at local flea markets. 
He uses uv reactive fluorescent paints mixed with other paints to create amazing light reactive paintings that come alive and completely change when the lighting changes in the room.

All images used to render this website mock up have been deigned by me and created with the help of AI. All copyrights for the images used belong to me as well.
